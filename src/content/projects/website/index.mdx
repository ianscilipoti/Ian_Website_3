Overview
---

I recently set myself to redesigning my personal website (thanks for visiting it!). I have gone through this process a few times over the years and each time it aligns with a major shift in my attitude and approach to what I do. 

This latest revision followed a deeper exploration into design as well as an increasing interest in AI-assisted software development. 

This redesign began in Figma. As I've worked with designers at TPN, I've picked up a lot of ideas about Figma variables, consistent spacing, and color theory. I tried to employ all of these ideas in this design. 

In the past, I've used Gatsby/React for my personal websites. I'm glad I had the opportunity to learn these frameworks from scratch without AI. I truely believe that process is valuable. That said, for this iteration, I focused on maximizing my development velocity with AI. 

I approach AI-assisted development as a partnership. My goal is to understand all of the code that is generated, but to avoid using my time needlessly on grinding out details. This latest redesign took place in about a week while working on it for a few hours here and there.
