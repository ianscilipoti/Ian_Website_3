The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is the science arm of the Department of the Interior. The USGS brings an array of earth, water, biological, and mapping data and expertise to bear in support of decision-making on environmental, resource, and public safety issues.

Case Study: **ADONNIS**
===

I developed ADONNIS (Automated Downstream Order Naming Numbering Identification System) for the USGS over a six-month contract. ADONNIS is an initiative designed to automate a cumbersome process of generating station identification numbers for the USGS nationwide stream gauge network. 

My role:
---
1. Software Engineering.

Accomplishments:
---
1. Engineered constraint satisfaction algorithms to validate messy real-world datapoints.
2. Developed graph traversal algorithms to process stream network data from government databases.  
3. Built an error detection system capable of generating simple technical descriptions of data inconsistencies and how to fix them. 
4. Created an interactive frontend using Leaflet to display complex geospatial data and process user queries.  
5. Successfully automated a complex routine task from multiple days to a matter of seconds.
