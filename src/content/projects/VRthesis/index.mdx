My thesis research during undergrad focused on novel VR spatial interfaces for 3D modeling. My research included a survey of spatial modeling solutions in the field, two prototype interfaces, and a user study of twenty-five participants from various technical backgrounds and experiences with VR applications. The project was awarded the best thesis of the computer science department for the academic year.

My role:
---
1. Software Engineering.
2. Research.
3. User study management.

Accomplishments:
---
1. Designed, prototyped, and implemented two novel interfaces for 3D sculpting in VR using Unity3D. 
2. Planned, applied for funding, and conducted a user study (n = 25) comparing the two unique interface designs using quantitative and qualitative metrics. 
3. Wrote a technical report in LaTeX including a survey of existing work, methodology, and quantitative user study results.
