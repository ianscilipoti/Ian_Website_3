**Flywheel** is a digital commerce SaaS company. They are the largest consumer of Amazon's sales data. I work for an internal agency of Flywheel that primarily works with AT&T. 

Case Study: **Builder.io Migration**
===

Our team transitioned to Builder.io, an exciting new offering in the content management system (CMS) space. The transition gave us an opportunity to empower our design team to build more on their own **without relying on engineering resources**.

My role:
---
1. Technical consultant.
2. Software development.
3. Managing design team transition.

Accomplishments:
---
1. Conducted R&D and wrote a strategic POV, **guiding agency-wide decision making to choose Builder.io** over other CMS options.
2. Developed reusable CMS-compatible **components in React** and guided development of an internal **design-system**. 
3. **Co-hosted workshops** on best practices for content organization, CSS, and Figma workflows for an eight-person design team.
4. **Led the design team** through multiple **successful launches**, assisting with content setup, QA, and deployment.

Case Study: **Rapid Prototyping** 
===

Our agency regularly engages in prototyping efforts. Our objective for prototyping is concept validation, client pitching, and user testing. 

In this example, for a client pitch, the agency tasked me to build a functioning prototype over a one-week sprint. 

My Role:
---
1. Full-stack development.
2. Fleshing out design concepts.
3. Managing 3D assets and pipelines.

Accomplishments:
---

1. Successfully developed a working prototype for a 3D product viewer, convincing the client to approve a **multi-six-figure project**.
2. Delivered regular prototypes involving multiple screens, hardware components, and Arduino, resulting in client excitement and new project leads.

Case Study: **Physical On-Site Product Customization**
===

Our client engaged us to discover retail solutions for on-site product customization using techniques like laser etching, printing, embroidery, etc. 

My role:
---

1. External vendor discovery, outreach, and communication.
2. Developing client presentation decks.
3. Regular reports and presentation to executive leadership.

Accomplishments:
---

1. Led vendor communication and coordination for **six external vendors** over a **three-week sprint** while balancing deadlines and deliverables.

Case Study: **Design Explorations and Creative Technology**
===

Part of my role as a Creative Technologist is to engage in creative projects that are technical in nature. At the intersection of design and technology, I add value through deep understanding of creative pipelines for user interfaces, 3D experiences, animation, as well as specialized tools for technical content production such as Blender and TouchDesigner.

My role:
---

1. 3D designer.
2. Frontend Engineer.

Accomplishments:
---

1. Led creation of guidelines for producing 3D anamorphic video content, resulting in new content production work streams. 
2. Assisted in creating concepts for in-store video content relying on 3D anamorphic effects.  
3. Prototyped design motifs portraying AT&T products in "experiential" design language, opening the door for new ways of bringing AT&T products and services to life.
