Overview
----
Since 2022, I've been working as a Creative Technologist at TPN on the AT&T account. This work as led me to wear many hats and be exposed a wide range of projects featured across the nationwide AT&T retail fleet.

My contributions include rapid prototyping, technology R&D, interfacing between internal teams, and design explorations that explore brand guidelines.

Frontend Development
----

I've worked on most of AT&T's instore digital signage experiences with contributions ranging from concepting through implementation to user testing. My experience has reinforced the importance of clear design, motion, and responsiveness in designing frontend experiences. 

I led an initiative at TPN to encorperate Rive into our platforms. Rive is an interactive animation tool used by Duolingo, Spotify, and other major apps. In our organization, we have many talented designers and video editors / animators. However, these two groups are mostly silod. Through integrating Rive, both teams could contribute to our digital platforms enabling us to create more movement and delight in our digital products. 

I have also played a central role in the exploration and transition process as we migrated to a new content management system, Builder.io. My dual abilities as a technologist and a designer have enabled unique contribution on the team where these disiplines intersect.

Design Exploration
----

Exploring how the AT&T brand can be brought to life with creative technology has been an exciting process. In creating 3D visual FX to take a digital experience to the next level, or creating technical guidelines for creating 3D anamorphic video billboards, I've helped push the boundary on what our design team can output.

Technology
----

I have been central to several technology initiatives that we have pitched to AT&T. My technical contributions have ranged from creating physical prototypes with Arduino and Sensors, to coordinating with external vendors. 

Here are a few examples of these projects: 

* Lift and learn physical prototype built using WebSocket enabled synchronization between real-world retail hardware including Brightsign players, a smartTV, and a hand-soldered Arduino circuit for detecting product lift.

* R&D and vendor relations for on-site product customization experience using laser etching, printing techniques, and embroidery. 

* Creating tests and guidelines for pushing content interactivity on constrained digital signage hardware.
