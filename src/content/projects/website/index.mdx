Overview
---

I recently set myself to redesigning my personal website (thanks for visiting it!). I have gone through this process a few times over the years and each time it aligns with a major shift in my attitude and approach to what I do. This latest revision followed a deeper exploration into design as well as an increasing interest in AI-assisted software development. 

This redesign began in Figma. I have grown to love the interface and approach that Figma takes as it allows a rapid exploration of design and content architecture. Through my experience at Flywheel as a Creative Technologist, I have spent a lot of time in Figma creating designs as well as exploring best practices for design-to-code workflows. 

In the past, I've used Gatsby/React for my personal websites. I'm glad I had the opportunity to learn these frameworks from scratch without AI. I truly believe that process is valuable. That said, for this iteration, I focused on maximizing my development velocity with AI. 

I settled on using Astro as my framework. Astro allows me to create the abstractions and components that I'm looking for without all of the weight of a full-fledged front-end framework. 

I approach AI-assisted development as a partnership. My goal is to understand all of the code that is generated, but to avoid using my time needlessly on grinding out details. This latest redesign took place in about a week while working on it for a few hours here and there.
