Poetic was born out of an interest in having a social media like infinite scrolling experience without the bombardment that comes with most apps.

I set out to learn a few key things as I develop the app:
* Exploring using local AI models using Ollama
* Experiment with Claude Code and AI-assisted development
* Gain a deeper understanding of Docker and Postgres
* Brush up on my system architecture skills

This app is a work in progress, but has been a fantastic learning experience. Starting from scratch allowed me to fill in gaps in my understanding of software development that I didn't know about. As I have navigated using AI for software development, I've explored the balance of velocity and concrete understanding.
