Overview
----
Since 2022, I've been working as a Creative Technologist at TPN on the AT&T account. This work as led me to wear many hats and be exposed a wide range of projects featured across the nationwide AT&T retail fleet.

My contributions include rapid prototyping, technology R&D, interfacing between internal teams, and design explorations that explore brand guidelines.

Frontend Development
----

I have worked on most of AT&T's instore digital signage experiences with contributions including concepting, implementation, and user testing. My experience has reinforced the importance of clear design intent, motion, and responsiveness in designing frontend experiences. 

I have led various initiatives on the team including encorperating Rive into our digital platforms. Rive is an interactive animation tool used by Duolingo, Spotify, and other major apps. In our organization, we have many talented designers and video editors, however, these two groups are mostly siloed. Through integrating Rive, both teams have the potenital to bring their unique expertise to our digital platforms.

As the team migrated to a new content management system, I played a central role in the transition. My dual abilities as a software engineer and a designer have enabled unique contribution on the team where these disiplines intersect including developing design systems, exploring design to code pipelines, and evaluating tech stacks and tools to best facilitate our unique team structure. 

The work we do on our team supports content and platforms that are live every day in permanant in-store fixtures. As a result, care is taken to properly test and QA our work.

Design Exploration
----

Exploring how the AT&T brand can be brought to life with creative technology has been an exciting process. In creating 3D visual FX to take a digital experience to the next level, or creating technical guidelines for creating 3D anamorphic video billboards, I've helped push the boundary on what our design team can output.

Technology
----

I have been central to several technology initiatives that we have pitched to AT&T. My technical contributions have ranged from creating physical prototypes with Arduino and Sensors, to coordinating with external vendors. 

Here are a few examples of these projects: 

* Lift and learn physical prototype built using WebSocket enabled synchronization between real-world retail hardware including Brightsign players, a smartTV, and a hand-soldered circuit for detecting product lift.

* R&D and vendor relations for on-site product customization experience using laser etching, printing techniques, and embroidery. 

* Creating tests and guidelines for pushing content interactivity on constrained digital signage hardware.
