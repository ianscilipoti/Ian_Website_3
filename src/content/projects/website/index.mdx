I recently set about redesigning my personal website (thanks for visiting it!). I have gone through this process a few times over the years and each time it aligns with a major shift in my attitude and approach to what I do. This latest revision followed a deeper exploration into design as well as an increasing interest in AI-assisted software development. 

My role:
---
1. Design.
2. Software Engineering.

Accomplishments:
---
1. Designed the website using Figma best practices including the use of variables, components, and mobile-responsive auto-layout designs. 
2. Guided Claude Code with Figma MCP to implement my designs in the AstroJS framework. 
3. Polished website design and functionality through a mixture of prompting and manual coding.
