The cities project was a personal exploration of data structures and procedural content generation. I recently revised this project and implemented a prototype for AI agents in the city that can be interacted with. 

My role:
---
1. Software Engineering.

Accomplishments:
---
1. Designed algorithms for recursive mesh subdivision with an underlying graph data structure in C#. 
2. Built procedural mesh generation features relying heavily on vector and geometry math. 
3. Built a system for interfacing with GPT5-Nano, allowing AI agents to build social histories with each other using proximity-based interactions.
