Velan Studios is a medium-sized game development studio located in Troy, NY. Velan was founded by industry veterans and has worked on titles like Mario Kart Live, Knockout City, and Hot Wheels Rift Rally. 


Case Study: **Viper Engine**

While interning at Velan, I worked on the Viper Engine, a custom game engine built for their emerging title, Mario Kart Live. The engine was programmed in C and designed for the highest levels of optimization.
