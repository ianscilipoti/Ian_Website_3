This music visualizer was a pandemic project. It stemmed from an interest in music and building something in the physical world. The visualizer works by vibrating the surface of water with a DIY speaker coil, and projecting light through the rippled surface. 

My role:
---
1. Circuit design and prototyping. 
2. Software development for Arduino Uno. 
3. Physical prototyping with wood, buttons, etc. 

Accomplishments:
---
1. Designed a working prototype through a six-month R&D process.
2. Designed and implemented circuitry using an integrated audio amplifier chip, resistors, capacitors, and Arduino Uno microcontroller. 
3. Experimented with Fast Fourier Transform algorithms running on Arduino Nano for various reactive lighting features.
