This project explored Delaunay Triangulations as a visual medium for a low-poly aesthetic. I engineered a terrain engine using Delaunay Triangulations with features like procedurally generated rivers and lakes, level-of-detail for vegetation, and terrain topology generation using noise algorithms and Voronoi Diagrams for segmenting biomes and landscape types. 

My role:
---
1. Software Engineering.
2. 3D design.

Accomplishments:
---
1. Implemented a fully functional terrain engine in Unity3D using Delaunay Triangulations to render a stylized terrain surface.
2. Engineered a level-of-detail system for rendering massive amounts of trees using GPU instancing and custom shaders. 
3. Explored various terrain generation techniques including Perlin Noise, Voronoi Diagrams, erosion algorithms, and A* search for river generation.
